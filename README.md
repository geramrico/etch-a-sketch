## The Odin Project: Javascript Practice

This is part from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) Fullstack Javascript Curriculum.

So far I've learned:

- HTML
- CSS Basics
- Javascript fundamentals
- DOM Manipulation

I believe this project will help me consolidate what I've learnt so far, I'm writing this before starting so I hope to come back with some thoughts on what I learned, the challenges and anything relevant to solidify my knowledge.

### The reason for this:
> I want to prove myself I can become a self-taught dev and change my career path.
